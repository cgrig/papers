There is virtually no type-checking in Agent Oriented Programming at the
moment. Type errors can lead to erroneous calculations. We propose typing
beliefs and message content using abstract data types. We present a type-checking implementation.

\section{Introduction} % <<<
The intuition that a function is like a pair of messages, one carrying the
arguments and one carrying the result, led us to two interesting
observations. First, algebraic data types are convenient for describing the
content of messages. We expect to see fewer runtime errors once messages
are typed. Second, we developed a notion of role in the context of the 2APL
language. These roles have certain similarities with existing 2APL modules
and with Java interfaces, but are nevertheless distinct concepts.

We want types~\cite{DBLP:conf/ctcs/Hagino87}.

\section{Agent Factory} %<<<
Agent Factory~\cite{}1 is an open-source Java-based development framework
that provides support for the development and deployment of agent-oriented
applications.

Agent Factory (AF) provides a generic run-time environment for deploying
agent-based systems that is based on the FIPA standards~\cite{}7. Central
to this environment is a configurable agent platform that supports the
concurrent deployment of heterogeneous agent types employing a range of
agent architectures and interpreters. AF also supports the deployment of
platform-level resources in the form of platform services that are shared
amongst agents, along with monitoring and inspection tools that aid the
developer in debugging their implementations. 

The Common Language Framework (CLF) is a collection of components that
facilitates the design and implementation of diverse Agent Programming
Languages in AF. CLF includes a generic logic framework, a planning and
plan execution framework, a common API model based on sensors, actions and
modules, an outline Grammar and template compiler implementation based on
JavaCC, and a configurable debugging tool.

Currently there are four Agent Programming Languages that have been built
using the CLF: AFAPL, a reimplementation of the original Agent Factory
agent programming language that is based on commitment rules,
AF-AgentSpeak, an implementation of the AgentSpeak language based on
Jason, AF-TeleoReactive, an implementation of Nilsson's teleo-reactive
programming model, and AF-Raf, described in the next section.

Agent Factory is fully integrated with Eclipse in a way that simplifies
the task of providing support for new languages and architectures.

For further details on the current incarnation of Agent Factory the reader
is directed to~\cite{}10. Also, a discussion on the evolution of Agent
Factory since its inception in the early 1990s can be found in~\cite{}12.
