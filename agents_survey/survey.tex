\section{Introduction}

Compared to OOP (object oriented programming), AOP (agent oriented
programming) is done at a higher level of abstraction. The state of
an agent is a set of beliefs, which are described in a logic-like
language. The actions of the agent are dictated by declarative rules.
In AOP style it is easy to simulate societies and to code distributed
algorithms.

Clearly, AOP is inspired by sociology. Recently there has been
much interest in importing other concepts from sociology, roles
and organisations, in order to make it easier to write large scale
programs. In this paper we briefly review the concept of roles as it
is used in sociology and then survey attempts by computer scientists
to integrate those concepts in AOP languages and frameworks. We assume
that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of AOP (see, for
example, \cite{todo}).

\section{Roles in Sociology}

Roles are sets of connected behaviours, rights, and obligations
that correspond to the social position of a person (agent) in a
group (organisation). This definition is used both by functionalists
(for example, Auguste Comte) and by modern and contemporary
interactionists.


\section{Roles in Software Engineering}

AOP (agent oriented programming) is supported by languages and by
frameworks.

\subsection{Roles in AOP meta-models}

\subsubsection{AALAADIN} The AALAADIN meta-model, AGR, is described
as being a model for organisation centered multiagent systems.
AGR is based on three main concepts: agents, groups and roles.

An organisation is constituted of agents that manifest a behaviour.
The overall organisation can be partitioned into groups that may
overlap. 

Agents play roles within groups. A group can be viewed as a context
for activities. Two agents can interact only if they are member of
the same group, but usually an agent is member of several groups.
Groups are sets of agents that are sharing common characteristics, and
represent either sets of similar agents or function based systems.

A role describes an abstract behaviour of agents and represents the
abstraction of a functional position of an agent in a group.

\subsubsection{BRAIN} The BRAIN Framework is intended to support
the development of interactions in agent-based appllications, using
the concept of role. It is constituted of three components: the
interaction model, XRole -- an XML-based notation to express roles,
and Rolesystem -- an interaction infrastructure implementing the
proposed model.

A role is modeled as a set of capabilities -- activities that can be
performed, and an expected behaviour -- reactions to incoming events.
Roles are temporary, generic and related to contexts.

It is considered to be an interaction between two agents when an
agent performs an action, from the set of actions associated to its
role, and that action is translated into an event that is notified to
another agent which is expected to react conforming to its role.

The underlying interaction infrastructure provides the translation
from actions to events. In this particular case, the Rolesystem
implementation is written in Java, and it is built on top of the Jade
Platform.

\subsubsection{Moise+} The Moise+ organisational model is the first
one to join roles with plans. It consists of three main dimensions:
structural, functional and deontic. Roles represent the structural,
plans are the functional, and the relations between roles and plans
represent the deontic dimension.

The structural dimension has three levels. The individual level is
represented by the roles, that are viewed as sets of constraints
that agents ought to follow. The social level is represented by the
links, which are relations between the roles, and constrain the
agents behaviour in relation to other agents. And the colective level
is represented by the groups, which introduce the compatibility
constraints between roles, that specifies what roles an agent is
allowed to assume depending on the roles that it is currently playing.

The functional dimension is based on the concepts of missions (sets of
coherent goals that an agent can commit to), global plans (goals in a
structure) and Social Scheme (the goal decomposition tree).

The deontic dimension defines at the individual level the set of
obligations and permissions of a role on a mission.

Saci-Moise+, Jason-Moise+ and Moise+JavaAPI frameworks are all
implementations of the Moise+ meta-model.
