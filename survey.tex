\section{Introduction}

Compared to OOP (object oriented programming), AOP (agent oriented
programming) is done at a higher level of abstraction. The state of
an agent is a set of beliefs, which are described in a logic-like
language. The actions of the agent are dictated by declarative rules.
In AOP style it is easy to simulate societies and to code distributed
algorithms.

Clearly, AOP is inspired by sociology. Recently there has been
much interest in importing other concepts from sociology, roles
and organisations, in order to make it easier to write large scale
programs. In this paper we briefly review the concept of roles as it
is used in sociology and then survey attempts by computer scientists
to integrate those concepts in AOP languages and frameworks. We assume
that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of AOP (see, for
example, \cite{todo}).

\section{Roles in Sociology}

Roles are sets of connected behaviours, rights, and obligations
that correspond to the social position of a person (agent) in a
group (organisation). This definition is used both by functionalists
(for example, Auguste Comte) and by modern and contemporary
interactionists.


\section{Roles in Software Engineering}

AOP (agent oriented programming) is supported by languages and by
frameworks.
